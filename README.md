## Application Improvements

If given the opportunity to improve on this application, these are some of the things I can suggest:

1. Instead of using React Context as a state management tool, use React Redux instead.

2. Migrate all CSS stylings into their individual style sheets for each component.

3. Use Axios to handle API calls and requests.

4. Allow the user to reset the value of Pi to it's default/initial value.

5. Improve the UI of the components by using Tailwind CSS for more flexibility.
